## 📖 Project Overview
This project dives deep into **Airbnb listings data** to uncover insights about pricing, availability, host behavior, and location trends.  
Using a combination of **PostgreSQL (Supabase)**, **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**, and **Tableau**, I built a complete data pipeline — from data storage and cleaning to analysis and interactive dashboards.
